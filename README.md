## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflows


### What I learned

This project helped me better understand CSS Grid, particularly how to use grid-template-areas for flexible layouts. I also refined my background-image positioning skills, making sure elements aligned correctly within their containers.

### Continued development

I want to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox to create even more dynamic and adaptable layouts. Additionally, I plan to work more on accessibility, ensuring semantic HTML and ARIA roles improve usability for all users.

Iâ€™ll also explore CSS clamp() and min(), max() functions to make designs even more flexible.
